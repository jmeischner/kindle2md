## Motivation

I use the [Kindle Reader](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16571048011) and make highlights and notes on the books I read.
Unfortunately, the Kindle Reader does not provide a way to export these highlights and notes other than HTML.
As I use [Bear](https://bear.app/) to take notes and to fill my [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de), I wanted to convert these highlights and notes to Markdown format.
This is the motivation behind this project.

## What it does

It converts the Kindle HTML exports

to Markdown and create a new note with the highlights and notes in Bear.
